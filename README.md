# Breast Canceer Diagnosis


## Motivation
This is a capstone project for the Imperial College AI/ML Professional Certification. It will evaluate several machine learning techniques to make a binary classification prediction for a cancer diagnosis.  


## Data
The models would be trained and tested on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, available from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic.  See the Datasheet.md for further details.  The input sample file for the project is breast-cancer.csv.


## Models
Three supervised learning techniques will be used to approach this classification problem.  This dataset and problem was chosen due to it's relatively small data size, which can readily be run on a laptop, without specialised GPUs or large amounts of compute power.
